# 15-213 Intro To Computer Systems

This repo has my attmpt to Carnegie Mellon University *Intro to Computer Systems* course. Also know as 15-213.

The accompanying book for this course, which the course is based upon, and is also written by the course lecturers is **Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective** or **CS:APP**.

The repo will contains:

* Lectures and Recitations notes.
* Code snippets from various examples.
* Labs attempts.

## Why am I taking this course?

I am taking this course as a part of my [*Learning Computer Science Journey*](https://github.com/ossu), to enrich my knwoledge to computer systems which considered a crucial topic, as well as a part of my preparation to [*Operating Systems*](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/master/coursepages/ostep/README.md) course, which requires some prior knwoledge of computer systems.

[Python Tutor](https://pythontutor.com/c.html#mode=edit) is a useful websit to help you visualize your code, so you can see bit-manipulations in action. Make sure to use byte-level view of data.

Hope you find it useful, and wish me luck :)
